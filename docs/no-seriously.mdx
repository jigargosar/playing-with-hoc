> Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

  
```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
```

Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.

HOCs are common in third-party React libraries, such as Redux’s connect and Relay’s createFragmentContainer.
